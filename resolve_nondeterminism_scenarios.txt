All "more states" scenarios are nonsence. There isn't currently a way to split states and this is not condoned.
['more states', 'more transitions', 'more nondeterminism']
	- Bad

['more states', 'more transitions', 'less nondeterminism']
	- Nonsense. Metric will likely fail as (states * transitions) will outweigh resolution of nondeterminism

['more states', 'more transitions', 'same nondeterminism']
	- Bad.

['more states', 'less transitions', 'more nondeterminism']
	- Nonsense. There is no sensible way this would happen.

['more states', 'less transitions', 'less nondeterminism']
	- Nonsense but fine as long as the state increase doesn't outweigh the transitions and nondeterminism.

['more states', 'less transitions', 'same nondeterminism']
	- Nonsense but fine as long as the increase of states doesn't outweigh the transitions

['more states', 'same transitions', 'more nondeterminism']
	- Bad

['more states', 'same transitions', 'less nondeterminism']
	- Not awful - states now distinguished with guards and some states split

['more states', 'same transitions', 'same nondeterminism']
	- Bad

['less states', 'more transitions', 'more nondeterminism']
	- Nonsense. More transitions is silly

['less states', 'more transitions', 'less nondeterminism']
	- Nonsense. More transitions is silly

['less states', 'more transitions', 'same nondeterminism']
	- Nonsense. More transitions is silly

['less states', 'less transitions', 'more nondeterminism']
	- Acceptable. Merging states is good but may introduce some nondeterminism to be resolved of later

['less states', 'less transitions', 'less nondeterminism']
	- Ideal!

['less states', 'less transitions', 'same nondeterminism']
	- Good - eventually we'll reduce to very few states and then nondeterminism will play a larger role

['less states', 'same transitions', 'more nondeterminism']
	- Acceptable. Merging states is good but may introduce some nondeterminism to be resolved of later

['less states', 'same transitions', 'less nondeterminism']
	- Good - merged a pair of states and distinguished two transitions with a guard

['less states', 'same transitions', 'same nondeterminism']
	- Acceptable to continue

['same states', 'more transitions', 'more nondeterminism']
	- Bad - termination metric will kick it out

['same states', 'more transitions', 'less nondeterminism']
	- Nonsense. More transitions is silly

['same states', 'more transitions', 'same nondeterminism']
	- Nonsense. More transitions is silly

['same states', 'less transitions', 'more nondeterminism']
	- Not intended but conceivable if two transitions are merged and a guard is relaxed. As long as the nondeterminism increase is reasonable (i.e. less than the number of states in the machine) then the termination metric will allow it.

['same states', 'less transitions', 'less nondeterminism']
	- Good

['same states', 'less transitions', 'same nondeterminism']
	- Fine

['same states', 'same transitions', 'more nondeterminism']
	- Bad - kick it out

['same states', 'same transitions', 'less nondeterminism']
	- Fine - reducing nondeterminism is the aim

['same states', 'same transitions', 'same nondeterminism']
	- Bad - no progress made
